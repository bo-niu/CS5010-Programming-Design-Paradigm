Dear James Butt,
As you may have heard or read, last month we learned that criminals forced their way into our systems, 
and stole information about our customers. Late last week, as part of our ongoing investigation, 
we learned that the taken information includes name, company name, mailing address, phone number or email address and zip code.
 
I am writing to make you aware that your name, company name, mailing address, phone number or email address and zip code may have been 
taken during the intrusion. 

I am truly sorry this incident occurred, and I sincerely regret any inconvenience it may cause you. 

Because we value you as a customer, and because your trust is important to us, our company is offering you one 
year of free credit monitoring through Experian’s ProtectMyID product, which includes identity theft insurance 
where available. You will receive more information about this offer via regular mail.

You can find additional information and FAQs about this incident at our website. If you have further questions, 
you may call us at 866-852-8680. 

Thank you for your patience and your loyalty. 
Sincerely,
Insurance Company CEO
