Dear [[first_name]] [[last_name]],
As you may have heard or read, last month we learned that criminals forced their way into our systems, 
and stole information about our customers. Late last week, as part of our ongoing investigation, 
we learned that the taken information includes [[stolenInformation]]. 

I am writing to make you aware that your [[stolenInformation]] may 
have been taken during the intrusion. 

I am truly sorry this incident occurred, and I sincerely regret any inconvenience it may cause you. 

Because we value you as a customer, and because your trust is important to us, our company is 
offering you one year of free credit monitoring through Experianâ€™s ProtectMyID product, which includes 
identity theft insurance where available. Enclosed please find your additional information about your 
free credit card monitoring.


You can find additional information and FAQs about this incident at our website. If you have further questions, 
you may call us at 866-852-8680.
 
Thank you for your patience and your loyalty. 

Sincerely, 
Insurance Company CEO
